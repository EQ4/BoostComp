  BoostComp version 0.01 (Wolf Sound)

==================================================================
  BoostComp is a Waveshaper, that can be use for distortion, 
  boosting and compressing an input stereo signal.
==================================================================

  VST source code is provided for making the plug-in working 
  under DAW software running on both Windows and Linux.
  Faust source code is included in order to obtain the source
  code of other plug-in formats such as lv2, ladspa, au and many
  more.

  A copy of the VST 2.4 SDK is not included because it is not 
  compatible with the GPL license of this plug-in.

  To compile the plug-in the files Makefile must be adjusted.
  In particular, folders are expressed in a Linux-like 
  standards, and cross compilation of the Windows plug-in is set
  by default.
